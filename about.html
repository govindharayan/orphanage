  "Children born to this world are the adults of tomorrow. It’s important to take care of abandoned children so they grow into responsible, self sufficient and relatively emotionally stable human beings (I say relatively because sense of abandonment is a life long trauma many may live with if never adopted into loving and caring families). Some may say that what makes us compassionate animals is taking care of vulnerable human beings even if they’re not ours. Most other animal species do the same. Thank nature for that.

  On the other hand, those who find themselves pregnant and unable to care for a child, must have safe options to preserve life and possibly help that child find a loving family who is ready to care for him/her.
  
  Not every country has orphanages, we have a foster care system but as a developed society, we take on the social responsibility for taking care of those who can’t take care of themselves for the good of all.
